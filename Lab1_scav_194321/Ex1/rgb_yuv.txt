In this first exercise we take an image in RGB, convert it to YUV and do the opposite
operation.

With the plots we must be able to see that the final result ("Reconverted") shold be
very similar to the reference ("Original").

I wasn't be able to plot and compare it because the Ubuntu application does not recognize
the screen to show it.
